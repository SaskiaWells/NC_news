# Northcoders News API

Welcome to the backend of my Northcoders solo project.
In this project, I was given the task of making my first full stack web application in 5 days; this was a mock news app using data that was given to us by the Northcoders team.

The data given to us was psql, and I created the API using node-postgres and javascript, jest and husky was used to create an automated test suite. 

Here is the hosted version fof my API: https://nc-news-tm65.onrender.com
